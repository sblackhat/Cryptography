# Cryptography
Implementation on various cryptography algorithms using the material concepts behind them.
This scripts are written using python combined with sage library to test the cases written in python.
The IDE used for this repo is the jupyter notebook.
The implemented are the following:
  - RSA
  - Diffie-Hellman key exchange with DLP brute-force attack
  - AES encryption
  - Elliptic Curves
        - Operation on Elliptic curves (addtion, multiplication, substration...)
        - Enconding and Decoding on Elliptic Curves.
        - El Gamal Encryption and Decryption on Elliptic Curves.

Test cases are included for each function to prove that works as expected.
